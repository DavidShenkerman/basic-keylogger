# basic-keylogger
This is a very basic keylogger in python. It is for educational purposes, and can only function if certain security protections are turned off, depending on the system on which this is implemented. This project utilizes the pynput and logging python libraries to listen to and log every key pressed to a text file. Each key is logged with a date and a representation of which key was pressed.  Future projects could include emailing updates of the keylogs to a certain address, or better concealing the keylogger so that it isn't easily detected by the operating system.
